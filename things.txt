things that I want to talk about.

My purpose of going to Coffee meets Bagel: Looking for relationship, a boyfriend.

My purpose of being in a relationship: Marriage.

My view of faith: I am a Christian, a Christ follower/
 I am a sinner, I know that Jesus Christ died for my sin on the cross/ 
 I believe that God is 3 in 1 God the Father, God the Son, Jesus Christ and GOd the Holy Spirit./ 
 I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior, and want a close relationship with my savior.

My value of a marriage: Acroding to my understanding of the Bible, God created men and women to be euqally suitable for each other. Jesus Christ is the head of Church, and of us, he is our shield, and sherphard. Man leads the family. Jesus loves the church, died for the church. Man loves woman and will protect woman. the church is led by Christ, woman is led by man. Christ takes responsibility to the church, He died for our sin. Man takes responsibility and protect his family.

How my family raised me: born of an Asian family, I grew up in a environment that my family loves me and my brother, they'd do anything for us. I was tought to be kind, gentle, nice, knows manner.
